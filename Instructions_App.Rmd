# How do I use this application?

That's a great question! This application is broken into three parts, as indicated on the tabs above. The first tab, **simulation graphs**, allows you to run a selection of interventions and model the projected change in demand. On the second tab, **modeling methods**, you can explore the four underlying methods that feed into our model. The third tab, "custom elasticities", allows you to upload your own set of price elasticities to run one of the model methods. 

Each tab follows a similar format: Inputs can be selected in the sidebar, while the modeled outputs are displayed in the center of the page. Below are instructions for how to select a set of interventions on each tab. 

CUT: Below are details on how the widgets work, what some of the inputs are, and how you can change them in order to create some outputs. The widgets are on the left in the **sidebar.**

&nbsp;

## Tab 1. Simulation Graphs

On the first tab, you can run our model with any set of interventions. To do so, **hoose your inputs in the sidebar** as described below. 

&nbsp;

#### **1. Choose how many simulations you want to run**

This will decide how many times the model is run to create your charging demand simulation. The more times the model is run, the more robust the simulated result. However, since each model run is randomized, the variance in outcomes will be greater.

The top graph that you'll see on the right is the **mean** of the amount of simulations. The bottom graph displays all of the model simulations so you can see the **range** between the 4 methods used to create the simulation.

Choose from the dropdown how many times you want the model to run (1, 10, 100 or 1000 times). Note: the higher the number, the longer the loading time.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

#### **2. Choose how many chargers you want in your simulation**

The amount of chargers will affect the amount of charging demand that you're trying to simulate. You might want to see how much charging demand your place of employment might have with something low like 20 chargers. Or you might want to simulate an entire metropolitan area with a value closer to 1,500 chargers. Type in the number you want in the top box labeled "Number of Chargers" or use the up/down arrows to increase/decrease the value.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

#### **3. Choose your market segment**

A market segment refers to the place where EVs charge. The four market segments evaluated for our project and thus available in this application are:

- Workplaces (places of employment)
- Destination Centers (shopping malls, hotels or other public, commercial spaces)
- Fleets (groups of EVs operated by a business, government, or any other organization)
- Multi-Unit Dwellings (dwellings that are not considered private, single-family or low density homes such as condominiums or apartment buildings)

Choose your market segment by selecting 1 of the 4 from the drop down menu labeled "Market Segment."

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

#### **4. Choose the date that you want to represent**

To determine how demand changes, we need to know what our baseline daily demand looks like. This application has baseline data from some chargers in Southern California from 2017 and 2018. Select the date (month and year) you would want to set your baseline at. If nothing is selected, the model will default to November of 2018, the final month of data we received for this project, and thus the most recent data available to us. 

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

#### **5. Choose what type of price intervention you might want to offer**

A pricing intervention is one type of incentive that is offered to EV drivers in order to induce a change in behavior.  A **discount** is a cheaper price of electricity to encourage consumers to use more electricity. This is typically applied in the middle of the day to encourage the use of electricity that is powered with solar energy.  A **rebate** is a bill credit given to consumers in order to use less electricity. This is typically offered in the evenings when demand is high.

These financial incentives can be applied in 4 ways:

1) Not at all, where no pricing intervention is selected.  

2) Only a discount.  
To do this, check the discount box. Then, **choose the amount** on the slider bar. Next, specify the **amount of time** you want the discount to be applied

3) Only a rebate.
Repeat the same process as described in step 2.

4) A discount and a rebate.
Repeat the same process as described in step 2 for both pricing interventions.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

#### **6. Apply a throttling rate to the chargers**

Throttling is when the power draw of the EV charger is manually reduced. For example, if a 6.6 kilowatt (kW) rated EV charger charges an EV for an hour, that EV would have used 6.6 kilowatt *hours* (kWh). But if 50% throttling was applied to that charger, only 3.3 kWh of electricity would have been used. In essence, this increases the amount of time it takes for an EV to fully charge.

In the model, the default for throttling is set at zero. To apply throttling, use the two sliders to *choose your percentage* and *time period* during which you want throttling to occur.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

#### **What next?**

The graphs and tables are reactive, so you don't need to push any buttons. The more simulations you run, the longer the app will take to load.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## Tab 2. Modeling Methods
On the second tab, **modeling methods**, you can explore the four underlying methods that feed into our model. Select inputs on the sidebar as you would on Tab 1. Simulation Graphs. But, on the right, instead of seeing one new demand line, representing an average of the 4 methods used here, you see one run of the model with each method. This allows you to explore the 4 methods for determining how demand changes.
