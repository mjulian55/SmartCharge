## Application Overview

This application is meant to simulate the change in electric vehicle (EV) charging demand based on changing various inputs that affect charging behavior. Those inputs may be technological, such as reducing the power that an EV charger can use, or economic, such as lowering or raising the price of electricity. Any combination of these things will affect the amount of electricity consumers demand for EV charging.

Through this application, you can choose your own combination of inputs to see how they might be able to change demand!

### Electric Vehicle Charging and Why It's Important

Electric Vehicles are increasing in popularity and projections indicate that they're only going to become more popular. California currently has the largest EV market in the U.S. and seeks to put 5 million zero emission vehicles on its roads by 2030. And all of these EVs will need to charge on our electricity grid. 

Grid operators and energy providers aren't just curious about *how much* electricity EVs will require for charging but *when* they will charge. In the state of California, there's an oversupply of solar energy in the middle of the day that can often be wasted. Rather than have all these new EVs charge at times when the grid receives power mostly from fossil fuel sources, like in the evening, energy providers want to see if it's possible to have EVs charge using all of that extra solar energy. Charging with renewable power can lessen the demand for fossil fuel based power, and decrease the excess supply of solar in the middle of the day.  This helps smooth out balance of supply and demand and creates a more predictable and reliable electricity grid. Midday charging also helps California maximize the greenhouse gas and air pollution benefits of EVs.

### Why Was This App Built?

This Application was developed as part of the "Smart Charge" Master's Project at the UC Santa Barbara's Bren School of Environmental Science & Management. Information on the Bren School's master's projects can be found [here](https://www.bren.ucsb.edu/research/masters_projects_landing.htm).
